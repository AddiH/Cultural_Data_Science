# 15-minute-city
This study focuses on evaluating the walkability of Aarhus municipality, Denmark, within the framework of a "15-minute city." The 15-minute city concept emphasizes convenient access to essential amenities within a 15-minute walk, promoting healthier urban living. This study assess the percentage of Aarhus municipality's area within a 15-minute walk of key daily amenities: supermarkets, day-cares, and general practitioners.

The analysis indicates that 58% of the total city zone qualifies as a 15-minute city, with 79% of the area having access to supermarkets, 62% to general practitioners, and 86% to day-cares. While city-zoning discrepancies and availability limitations pose challenges, the study provides valuable insights for urban planning.

The findings pinpoint areas that may benefit from enhanced amenity provision, like Lisbjerg, a city development project without key amenities. Moreover, the map serves as a tool for broader analyses, such as examining housing prices' relationship with walkability and socioeconomic patterns within the 15-minute city framework, contributing to more liveable urban environments.
